## 🔧 Backend Utilities

### Available Functions (from `/lib/auth.ts`)
```typescript
// Client-side
signUp(email, password, metadata)
signIn(email, password)
signOut()
getCurrentUser()
resetPassword(email)
updatePassword(newPassword)

// Server-side
getServerUser()
isStudent(userId)
isAdmin(userId)
getUserRole(userId)
getStudentProfile(userId)
getAdminProfile(userId)
```

---

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Automatic Profile Creation
When a user signs up, their profile (student or admin) is automatically created.

### 2. Payment Integration
When an admin records a payment, the student's `payment_status` is automatically updated.

### 3. Exam Access Control
Students can only access exams if:
- They're enrolled in the course
- Payment is confirmed
- They haven't taken the exam yet

### 4. Automatic Grading
Exams are automatically graded when submitted. Scores, percentages, and pass/fail status are calculated.

### 5. Admin Tracking
All payments and exams track which admin created them for accountability.

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

### Create Test Admin (after signup)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO admins (user_id, name, email, role)
VALUES (
  'user-id-from-auth-users',
  'Test Admin',
  'admin@test.com',
  'super_admin'
);
```

### Check API Health
```bash
# Test if server is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses

# Should return: {"courses": []}
```
