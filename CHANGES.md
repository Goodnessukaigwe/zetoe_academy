# 🎯 Updated Project Overview - Manual Payment System

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Paystack Integration**

- ❌ Removed Paystack environment variables
- ❌ No automatic payment gateway
- ✅ Manual payment recording by admins

### 2. **Updated Database Schema**

The `payments` table now reflects manual management:

**Before:**

```sql
payments (
  status TEXT ('pending', 'success', 'failed'),
  reference TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Paystack reference
  payment_method TEXT DEFAULT 'paystack',
  metadata JSONB
)
```

**After:**

```sql
payments (
  payment_method TEXT DEFAULT 'cash', -- Manual methods
  reference TEXT, -- Optional manual reference
  notes TEXT, -- Admin notes
  recorded_by UUID REFERENCES admins(id) -- Track who recorded
)
```

### 3. **Updated RLS Policies**

- ✅ Only admins can create payment records
- ✅ Only super admins can delete payments
- ✅ Students can view their own payments
- ✅ Admins can view and update all payments

### 4. **Updated TypeScript Types**

```typescript
// Old
export type PaymentTransactionStatus = "pending" | "success" | "failed";

// New
export type PaymentMethod = "cash" | "bank_transfer" | "card" | "other";

// Updated Payment interface
export interface Payment {
  payment_method: string; // 'cash' | 'bank_transfer' | 'card' | 'other'
  reference: string | null; // Optional manual reference
  notes: string | null; // Admin notes
  recorded_by: string | null; // Admin who recorded payment
}
```

### 5. **Updated Documentation**

- ✅ README.md - Removed Paystack references
- ✅ Created PAYMENT_SYSTEM.md - Complete payment management guide
- ✅ Updated .env files - Removed Paystack keys

## 📋 New Payment Workflow

### For Students:

1. Register for a course (payment status: `unpaid`)
2. Pay via cash/transfer/card locally
3. Wait for admin to confirm payment
4. Access exams once status is `paid`

### For Admins:

1. Collect payment from student (offline)
2. Log into admin dashboard
3. Record payment details:
   - Amount
   - Payment method
   - Reference number (optional)
   - Notes (optional)
4. Update student payment status to `paid`
5. Student can now access course materials

### For Super Admins:

- All admin functions
- Can delete incorrect payment records
- Full oversight of all payments
