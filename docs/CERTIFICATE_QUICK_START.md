→ Confirm user is admin in `admins` table

### Check if migration worked:
```sql
SELECT * FROM certificates LIMIT 1;
```

### Generate a code:
```sql
SELECT generate_certificate_code();
```

### Count certificates:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates;
```

### List recent certificates:
```sql
SELECT certificate_code, student_name, course_name, issue_date 
FROM certificates 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
