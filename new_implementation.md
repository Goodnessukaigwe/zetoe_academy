my clients love this website but there are some changes he want

1. Remove the email verification system, email address should just be an information like phone number on the data base
2. username and password should be whats used to login for student, the username na should be auto generated while registering a student. and the password should be set by the super admin, note the password should note be must not insist on including special characters and all the password security checkers.
3. the super admin should be able to upload student photo and it will take effect on the student dash board
   4 sudent should not be able to register them self remove the registration button and page
4. student should not be able to enroll for course as the way the websibite works, the platform should just list the courses on the courses page.
